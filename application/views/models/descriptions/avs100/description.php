<p>Most of the previous transport (I-V ) modeling efforts in GFETs have relied on the drift-diffusion (DD) theory of electron transport with density-dependent saturation velocity [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. As such the validity of DD-based models may be limited
    to long channel devices.

    At MIT, an alternate transport model based on the concept of virtual source (VS) charge/velocity has been developed for GFETs in both unipolar and ambipolar regimes of operation. The model is also supplemented with channel charge partitioning that is
    valid from the drift diffuive to the ballistic transport regimes, where the gradual channel approximation (GCA) is no longer valid.

    The figure in right side shows a GFET with its terminal voltages labeled as d (drain), g (gate),and s (source). The internal and external gate terminals are the same, while the internal drain and source terminals are labeled as di and si, respectively.
    Also labeled are the source and the drain channel-access resistances as Rs and Rd,respectively.

<p>This is a complete charge-based model for ideal symmetric double MOSFET with structure shown in the given figure. Its features include:
    <ol>
        <li>Inversion charge model from week inversion to strong inversion calculated from the solution of 1D Poisson-Boltzmann equation [2] in the direction perpendicular to the gate</li>
        <li>Drain current model from the Pao-Sah’s dual integral [3]</li>
        <li>Can be applied to both intrinsic body as well has heavily doped body</li>
        <li>Source/drain charge model included based on the Ward and Dutton’s linear charge partition scheme [4]</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>Missing features:
    <ol>
        <li>Short channel effects</li>
        <li>Quantum effects</li>
        <li>Gate depletion effects</li>
        <li>Output resistance in saturation</li>
        <li>Mobility and velocity saturation models</li>
    </ol>

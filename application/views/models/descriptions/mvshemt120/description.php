    Silicon MIT virtual source (Si-MVS) model is a semi-empirical model that describes the short-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect transistor (MOSFET) current versus voltage characteristics and is valid in all regions of operation with continuity
    of both current and its derivatives[1]. The model also provides intrinsic charge descriptions that extend all the way to the ballistic regime, where gradual channel approximation (GCA) is often violated. Rather than calculating all the inter-terminal
    capacitances separately from the transport model[2], the intrinsic charges associated with each terminal are calculated self consistently with the current model[3]. The MVS model maintains the advantage of using only a limited number of input parameters,
    most of which have straightforward physical meanings and can be easily measured from device characterization[4].

    The Symmetric Doped Double-Gate MOSFET model (SDDGM) is an analytical compact model for Double-Gate MOSFETs and FinFETs, SOI or Bulk. It was validated for silicon layer concentrations from 10<sup>14</sup> and 3 x 10<sup>18</sup> cm-3, silicon thickness
    from 15 to 50 nm and EOT from 1 to 5 nm. This is a charge based model totally analytical and it was implemented in Verilog-A. The mobile charge density is calculated using analytical expressions obtained from modeling the surface potential and the
    difference of potentials at the surface and at the center of the Si doped layer without the need to solve any transcendental equations. Analytical expressions for the currentâ€“voltage characteristics are presented, as function of silicon layer impurity
    concentration, gate dielectric and silicon layer thickness, including variable mobility. The short channel effects included are velocity saturation, DIBL, VT roll-off, channel length shortening and series resistance. Some basic articles about SDDGM
    are referenced.

    The Stanford University CNFET Model is a SPICE-compatible compact model which describes enhancement-mode, unipolar MOSFETs with semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes as channels. Each device may have one or more carbon nanotubes with user-specified
    chirality, and the effects of channel length scaling can be accurately modeled down to 20nm. The model is based on a quasi-ballistic transport picture and includes an accurate description of the capacitor network in a CNFET. It accounts for several
    practical non-idealities, including the scattering of carriers due to the acoustic and optical phonons in the nanotubes, the parasitic capacitance between the gate and the source/drain formed by multiple 1D nanotubes, the gate-to-gate and gate-to-contact-plug
    capacitances, the charge screening among the adjacent nanotubes, the access resistance of the source/drain extension regions, the Schottky-barrier resistance at the metal-nanotube contact interfaces, and the band-to-band leakage current. The model
    has been used to perform circuit-performance comparison with the standard digital library cells between CMOS random logic and CNFET random logic. In addition, by including a full transcapacitance network, it also produces better predictions of the
    dynamic performance and transient response. The CNFET model can be instantiated directly in SPICE netlists to explore the impacts of CNFETs on the circuit performance. It is an accurate and handy tool for design exploration and verification of CNT
    circuits.

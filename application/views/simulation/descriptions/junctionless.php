        <p>Junctionless transistor is considered as a promising device to extend the limit of traditional MOSFETs due to 
its simple fabrication, no abrupt junction technology restrict and superior performance. The Junctionless model here is a 
potential-based compact model for double-gate Junctionless Transistor (DGJT), which is valid in all operation regimes 
for a wide device parameters. While due to the lack of capacitance model, the AC simulation is not available yet.
